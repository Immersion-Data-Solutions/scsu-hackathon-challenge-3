# IDS & SCSU Hackathon Feb. 2024 Challenge 3 - GLTF 3D Tile Generation

## Team: *insert team name*

## Challenge Description
A challenge IDS needs to overcome to transform our 2D mapping experience into 3D is how to efficiently load and visualize large amounts of 3D data. There is an industry standard called 3D Tiles that represents 3D data in a tiled format similar to how 2D mapping data can be tiled to allow the consumer to only load the data in view. We would like a way to take any GLTF model and automatically generate 3D tiles that can be visualized with our mapping technologies.

## Pillars
Compose, Explore

## Technologies
 - [React](https://react.dev/)
 - [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/)
 - [react-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/)
 - [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/community/education)
 - [GLTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/)
 - [3D Tiles](https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/geo-layers/tile-3d-layer)

## Test Data
This challenge uses sample GLTF models ranging in complexity.

## Target Outcome
There are tools out there that generate 3D tiles from GLTF models, but many of them are paid services, we'd like to get a processing pipeline in place that is open source that we can incorporate into our own custom processing pipelines. The goal of this challenge is to demonstrate usage of an open source GLTF to 3D tile tool and visualize the result in deck.gl with a Tile3DLayer.

## Judging Feedback
*Provided after hackathon judging is completed.*

## Culture Index Survey
Immersion Data Solutions has engaged with a behavior assessment company, Culture Index. We use it to better understand the intrinsic motivational needs and preferred communication style of our team members; ensuring their current roles fit their strengths and fulfillment needs.

We are pleased to offer you the chance to take the assessment and view your results. The process takes roughly 8 minutes or less. By participating, you will gain insights into your own behavioral tendencies and preferences, which can be invaluable for personal and professional development.
